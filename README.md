# Plinth

_Music to work to._

Plinth is a fullstack web app that recommends albums based on your taste preferences. Describe what you want to hear — by genre, mood, tempo, era, or energy — and Claude finds something worth listening to. Each recommendation comes with album artwork, streaming links, and a network of connected artists to explore further.

Powered by Claude AI, MusicBrainz, and the iTunes Search API.

## Features

### Recommendations

- **Preference-driven suggestions** — Set genres, moods, tempo, energy, density, and era. Claude uses these signals to recommend albums that fit.
- **Pivot controls** — After each recommendation, choose _More like this_ or _Something different_ to steer the next suggestion without adjusting preferences manually.
- **Seed by artist** — Click any connected artist chip to ask Claude to recommend from that artist's catalogue specifically.

### Connected Artists

Each recommendation surfaces a network of related artists via MusicBrainz — collaborators, side projects, former members, and recording co-credits. Clicking a chip seeds the next recommendation.

### History

- Recommendations are saved in `localStorage` and survive page reloads.
- Click any previously suggested album in the history grid to restore it as the current recommendation.
- History is capped at 50 entries and entries older than 90 days are pruned automatically.

### Library Export & Import

- **Export** — Download your recommendation history as a versioned JSON file (`plinth-library-YYYY-MM-DD.json`).
- **Import** — Load a library file from another session or a friend. Duplicate albums are deduplicated automatically; existing entries take precedence.

### Insights

A dedicated page breaking down your recommendation history:

- Summary stats — total albums, unique artists, decades spanned, countries explored
- Monthly activity chart
- Decade, genre, and country breakdowns
- Top artists by recommendation count
- Gap observations (e.g. genres or decades underrepresented in your history)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker + Docker Compose (for the full stack)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd plinth
npm install
cd server && npm install && cd ..
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your keys. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) below.

### 3. Run

**With Docker (recommended):**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Locally (two terminals):**

```bash
# Terminal 1 — server (port 3001)
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — client (port 5173)
cd client && npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
